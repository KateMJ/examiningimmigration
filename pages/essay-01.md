## Introduction

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! 

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:

# Heading One

## Heading Two

### Heading Three, etc.

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four

### My First Subheading

A horizontal line break can be useful for separating content:

----

Include an image:

{% include feature/image.html filename="demo_001.jpg" alt="image of UI Admin building" caption="Historic photo of the University of Idaho campus" width="50" %}

Include a pdf:

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="demo_002.pdf" caption="Historic postcard" width="50" %}
