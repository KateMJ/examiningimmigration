# Examining Immigration: 20th Century Legislation, Policies, and Reforms for Immigration in the United States.

## Introduction

At the beginning of the century, an ideological shift occurring in America changed what had been a historically open attitude toward those coming to our shores. The United States has a long history with immigration. In many ways, our nation as we know it today was founded on it. Unless you are native American, one can say that we are all immigrants. Surprisingly, According to an NYU press blog in 2019, 45.7% of Americans felt that deportation was a good solution for immigration issues.  However, where do these feelings stem from, and do federal government regulations (set a precedent) play into these sentiments? Immigration reforms and regulations enacted by the United States Government throughout the 20th century shifted the realities of Congressional power while also reshaping America’s ideology about immigrants. 

Much of the 20th century was wrought with anti-immigration sentiments and the desire to limit specific people groups from coming into the US. Although anti-immigration feelings were strong in the 19th century, the trend towards limiting and controlling immigration on a large scale mainly happened within the 20th century. Throughout the century, many policies and legislation were enacted to limit the ability of people to immigrate severely. These political policies attempted to restrict groups based on nationality, literacy, physical aptitude, lifestyle choices, and even financial soundness. 

President McKinley was greeting visitors on September 6, 1901. One of the hands that he attempted to shake was concealing a revolver, which put two bullets in his chest before the President was ever able to clasp his hand with the man. These bullet wounds came from a self-proclaimed anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, leading to President McKinley’s death a week later.  In the September 7 edition of the San Fransisco Call, writer Henry E Highton wrote, “In the midst of righteous indignation, Americans will preserve their balance, but they have learned their lesson and will sternly administer the remedy.”  This stern remedy would play out through the rest of the 20th century.

In her article entitled *Global Anti-Anarchism: The Origins of Ideological Deportation and the Suppression of Expression*, Julia Rose Krant explains that this was the “shot that shocked the world." Asserting that this assassination began a trend that would persist throughout the century of limiting immigration and using federal law to control the type of people allowed to enter the United States. The death of President McKinley led to the passing of the United States’ first Federal law authorizing exclusion and even deportation of immigrants based on their “ideological beliefs, associations, and/or expressions.” 

## Legislation

The Alien Immigration Act, also known as the Anarchist Exclusion Act, was implemented in 1903, marking a shift in government regulation regarding immigrants. This act contained 28 rules that were to govern immigration laws and regulations. It also lined out specific types of immigrants that were excluded from admission in the United States.

*“All idiots, insane persons, epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons who have been convicted of a felony or of a crime, or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the over¬ throw, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States, or of all government, or of all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials; prostitutes, and persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes or women for the purpose of prostitution;”*

This timeframe also began a movement where the United States government would begin a series of roadblocks to make immigration logistically much more difficult. Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1917, which included the requirement that those immigrating must have the ability to read and write in their native language. This year marked the beginning of the Immigration Service using literacy tests as a prerequisite to immigration.
