# 20th Century Legislation, Policies, and Reforms for Immigration in the United States.

## Introduction

At the beginning of the 20th century, an ideological shift in America changed a historically open attitude toward those coming to our shores. The United States has a long history with immigration; in many ways, our nation as we know it today was founded on it. Unless you are Native American, one can say that we are all immigrants. Surprisingly, According to an NYU press blog in 2019, 45.7% of Americans felt that deportation was a good solution for immigration issues.[^1]  However, where do these feelings stem from, and do Federal government regulations play into these sentiments? Immigration legislation, policies, and reforms enacted by the United States Government throughout the 20th century shifted the realities of Congressional power while also reshaping America’s ideology about immigrants. 

Much of the 20th century was wrought with anti-immigration sentiments and the desire to limit specific people groups from coming into the US. Although anti-immigration feelings were strong in the 19th century, the trend towards limiting and controlling immigration on a large scale mainly happened within the 20th century. Throughout this time period, many policies and legislation were enacted to limit the ability of people to immigrate severely. These political policies attempted to restrict groups based on nationality, literacy, physical aptitude, lifestyle choices, and even financial soundness.

President William McKinley was greeting visitors on September 6, 1901. Unbeknownst to him, one of the hands that he would attempt to shake was concealing a revolver, which put two bullets in his chest before the President was ever able to clasp hands with the man. These bullet wounds came from a self-proclaimed anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, leading to President McKinley’s death a week later.[^2]  In the September 7 edition of the *San Fransisco Call*, writer Henry E Highton wrote, “In the midst of righteous indignation, Americans will preserve their balance, but they have learned their lesson and will sternly administer the remedy.”[^3]  This stern remedy would play out through the rest of the 20th century.

In her article entitled Global Anti-Anarchism: The Origins of Ideological Deportation and the Suppression of Expression, Julia Rose Krant explains that this was the “shot that shocked the world.” Asserting that this assassination began a trend that would persist throughout the 20th century of limiting immigration and using federal law to control the type of people allowed to enter the United States. The death of President McKinley led to the passing of the United States’ first Federal law authorizing exclusion and even deportation of immigrants based on their “ideological beliefs, associations, and/or expressions.”[^4]

## Legislation

The Alien Immigration Act, also known as the Anarchist Exclusion Act, was implemented in 1903, marking a shift in government regulation regarding immigrants. This act contained 28 rules that were to govern immigration laws and regulations. It also lined out specific immigrants excluded from admission in the United States.

*“All idiots, insane persons, epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons who have been convicted of a felony or of a crime, or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the over¬ throw, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States, or of all government, or of all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials; prostitutes, and persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes or women for the purpose of prostitution;”*[^5]

The wave of immigration legislation persisted throughout the first half of the 20th century. Many saw this as the era of restrictions. Although more immigration laws were enacted after 1903, the next significant push for immigration legislation stemmed from fears created during World War 1.  Because of the mass immigration that resumed after World War 1, Congress reacted with the Emergency Quota Law of 1921. This law was the first legislation severely limiting the number of immigrants allowed to enter the United States. This act of Congress reduced immigration to allow 350,000 people per year. It also specified quotas that only 3% of the total population of that nationality, based on the 1910 census.[^6]   

On top of the quotas, there were strict rules regarding the requirements to come into the United States, “The State Department distributed a limited number of visas each year through US Embassies abroad, and the Immigration Service only admitted immigrants who arrived with a valid visa.”[^7]  Much of these limitations and quotas were based on the belief that America should limit immigrants from “undesirable” areas. “The immigration quotas of 1921 started a long line of legislation that attempted to block certain types of immigration. Immigration statistics display the detrimental effect these quotas had on specific ethnic groups.”[^8]

This limitation intensified in the National Origins Act of 1924. The total number of allowed immigrants was again lowered, allowing just 165,000 people per year. New quotas were implemented that brought the limits down to just 2% of the total population of any nationality based on the 1890 census. However, these quotas did not include any immigrants from the Western Hemisphere.[^9]  In her article The Architecture of Race in American Immigration Law: A Reexamination of the Immigration Act of 1924, Mae Ngai acknowledges that quotas were only the first significant part of the Immigration Act of 1924. The second was “the exclusion of person’s ineligible to citizenship,” therefore limiting up to half of the population of the world from immigrating to the United States.[^10]  In 1929 the National Origins Act changed again, limiting the number of persons to 150,000 and linking the 2% quota to the 1920 census. This change limited the immigrants entering the United States from eastern and southern Europe even more significantly.[^11] 

During this era of anti-immigration policies, many still fought to limit those coming from eastern Europe. The number of refugees, specifically German Jewish refugees, had been growing since Hitler came into power in 1933.[^12]  Eventually, America could not turn a blind eye to the realities of World War 2 and the massive amount of people forced to leave their homelands. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed for approximately 200,000 refugees, defined as "Eligible Displaced persons" or orphans.[^13]  These displaced people were given visas without regard to existing quotas.

## Roadblocks

During this same timeframe, a movement had begun where the United States government would create a series of roadblocks to make immigration logistically much more difficult. . Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1917, which included the requirement that those immigrating must have the ability to read and write in their native language. This year marked the beginning of the Immigration Service using literacy tests as a prerequisite to immigration.[^14]

Due to the realities of World War 1, it is not surprising that President Woodrow Wilson was given many liberties in how he controlled the travel of immigrants. In August of 1918, he issued a presidential proclamation, also known as the Travel Control Act, requiring passports for any departure or departure entry into the United States. Congress did limit President Wilson’s “executive discretion when it came to citizens, even during wartime.”[^15] 

In response to the strict legislation and quotas legislated in 1921 and 1924, there was suddenly a massive rise in what was now considered illegal immigration. Land borders were the most accessible place to gain entry into the United States.[^16]  Consequently, in 1924 Congress approved the creation of the Border Patrol, “authorizing the expenditure of funds for both a land and coast patrol.”[^17]  A 1949 document created by the US Department of Justice: Immigration and Naturalization Service, explains the origins and purpose of the Border Control. “Its primary function is to detect and prevent the smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States, and to apprehend persons guilty of such violations.” This same document states that during the fiscal years from “July 1, 1936, to June 30, 1947, the Border Patrol apprehended 495,532 persons for violation of immigration and other laws”, working in connection with Federal, State, and local law enforcement.[^18] 

The Alien Registration Program was implemented in 1940 as a World War 2 national security measure. This program required all noncitizens over 14 to be fingerprinted and registered with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This documentation requirement included those current resident noncitizens in the United States and those newly arriving. Each immigrant was given an AR-2 Form “individually stamped with a unique personal identifier” and number.[^19]
